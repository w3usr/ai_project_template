- **Nature of Contribution**: Draft and edit; equipment list verified against the inventory
  sheet by {{NAME, CALLSIGN}}

## [2026-09-12 13:35 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Fork the W2NAF academic project template into a W3USR club template:
  rewrite the scaffold so it is directly applicable to University of Scranton Amateur Radio
  Club projects, add amateur-radio operating governance and a student-facing onboarding
  guide, and repoint the repository from `w2naf-academia` to `w3usr`.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `CLAUDE.md` (rewritten), `README.md` (rewritten),
  `.gitignore` (secrets, Node/web, bulk-data sections added),
  `ai/ai_usage_log.md` (reset as a W3USR template with a format block and example entry),
  `.claude/commands/commit.md` (added a pre-commit sensitive-material check and submodule
  push-order verification), `.claude/rules/ai-governance.md` (rewritten: FCC, ARDC, FERPA,
  coursework conflict, disclosure table), `.claude/rules/latex-writing.md` and
  `.claude/rules/python-code.md` (reworked for club use),
  `.claude/rules/amateur-radio-operations.md` (new), `.claude/rules/web-development.md` (new),
  `docs/ONBOARDING.md` (new). Git remote repointed to `git@github.com:w3usr/ai_project_template.git`.
- **Nature of Contribution**: Draft and scaffolding; policy text drafted from the prior
  template and from the applicable institutional, funder, and FCC policies
- **Human Review Status**: Pending review: the Part 97 section citations in
  `.claude/rules/amateur-radio-operations.md`, and the club roles named in `CLAUDE.md`,
  need verification by the trustee or advisor before this template is used for a real project
- **Git Hash**: f745d39

## [2026-09-12 13:38 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: License the template scaffold itself under CC BY 4.0, at NAF's
  direction, so other clubs may reuse it with attribution.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `LICENSE` (new), `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (instantiation
  step and directory tree updated to say the license is replaced rather than added)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Scaffolding. The CC BY 4.0 legal text was retrieved verbatim
  from https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt rather than reproduced
  from memory.
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified; license choice directed by NAF
- **Git Hash**: a64c44f

## [2026-09-12 13:39 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Fix license detection. GitHub reported the repository license as
  NOASSERTION because a hand-written preamble preceded the canonical CC BY 4.0 text in
  `LICENSE`, which defeats GitHub's license detection.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `LICENSE` (reduced to the canonical CC BY 4.0 text alone),
  `NOTICE` (new, carrying the copyright line, attribution string, and the note that the
  scaffold derives from the W2NAF academic template), `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (file
  tables updated)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Edit
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified
- **Git Hash**: 1813961

## [2026-09-12 13:39 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Punctuation sweep of the template's own files, replacing em dashes
  with the colon or semicolon that names the relationship, so the scaffold other projects
  copy is internally consistent.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `ai/ai_usage_log.md` (title, example-entry label, two review
  status lines), `.claude/commands/commit.md` (title)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Edit
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified
- **Git Hash**: c769950

## [2026-09-12 13:58 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Remove the FCC operating governance from the general template, at
  NAF's direction. Operating constraints do not apply to every club project and belong in a
  per-project rule file where they are required.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `.claude/rules/amateur-radio-operations.md` (deleted);
  `README.md` (pitch reduced to two items, rule-file table and prune list updated,
  "Non-Negotiables" reduced to the AI log alone); `CLAUDE.md` (directory tree, AI Governance
  section reduced to the log requirement plus a placeholder for project-specific rules);
  `.claude/rules/ai-governance.md` (FCC section removed and sections renumbered, "AI Is Not
  an Author" narrowed, project-specific-constraints placeholder added);
  `docs/ONBOARDING.md` ("three things" reduced to two, rule table and who-to-ask updated);
  `.claude/rules/python-code.md` ("Code That Touches the Radio" replaced with a general
  "Side Effects" section); `.claude/commands/commit.md` (log-file bullet removed from the
  pre-staging check)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Edit and deletion, at NAF's direction
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified; scope of the removal directed by NAF
- **Git Hash**: 3edc7ba

## [2026-09-12 14:06 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Make the signed Generative AI Use Agreement an explicit prerequisite
  in the onboarding document and across the template, and commit the agreement form itself.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `docs/ai_policy_agreement/` (HamSCI agreement PDF and DOCX,
  supplied by NAF, now tracked); `docs/ONBOARDING.md` (new opening section "First: sign the
  AI use agreement", summarizing the form's certifications; signing added to the
  first-fifteen-minutes checklist and to the who-to-ask table); `.claude/rules/ai-governance.md`
  (new "Prerequisite: The Signed Agreement" section; Scranton policy URL and Jesuit mission
  alignment added from the form); `CLAUDE.md` (directory tree and AI Governance section);
  `README.md` (pitch, file table, and placeholder-replacement step)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Edit. The summary of the agreement's terms was taken from the
  text of `HamSCI_AI_Policy_Agreement.pdf` rather than written from memory.
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified against the source document
- **Git Hash**: 1248074

## [2026-09-12 14:08 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Address signed AI use agreements to "a W3USR faculty advisor" rather
  than to a named-advisor placeholder, per NAF: the recipient may be him, his co-advisor
  Dr. Navid Shahrouzi, or a future advisor.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `docs/ONBOARDING.md` (return line and who-to-ask row),
  `.claude/rules/ai-governance.md` (prerequisite section), `README.md`
  (placeholder-replacement step, which no longer needs to mention the agreement)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Edit, at NAF's direction
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified
- **Git Hash**: c9aa3f1

## [2026-09-12 14:25 UTC]
- **Tool**: Claude (Anthropic), claude-opus-5
- **Session Purpose**: Correct the never-commit list, which barred credentials at any
  visibility. Per NAF, some private club repositories legitimately hold access information:
  the forthcoming w3usr.org-PRIVATE orchestrator repository needs it for deploy and
  development. Committing such material is to be "carefully and deliberately decided"
  rather than prohibited.
- **Sections/Files Affected**: `CLAUDE.md` (never-commit list split into at-any-visibility,
  public-only, and a deliberate-decision section with conditions; visibility criteria table
  updated); `docs/ONBOARDING.md` (student-facing credential bullet); `.claude/settings.json`
  (`permissions.deny` read rules for `.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/**`, `*.pem`, `*.key`,
  `**/credentials.json`); `README.md` (new instantiation step 4 on extending the deny rules,
  later steps renumbered, file table); `.claude/commands/commit.md` (pre-staging check);
  `.claude/rules/web-development.md` and `.claude/rules/python-code.md` (secrets guidance)
- **Nature of Contribution**: Edit, at NAF's direction. Permission-rule syntax verified
  against the Claude Code documentation at code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions rather than
  written from memory.
- **Human Review Status**: Reviewed and verified
- **Git Hash**: [pending]
